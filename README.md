This project is an inquiry into the player transfer market of the English Premier League (EPL), with an eye towards identifying heuristics or patterns to differentiate reliable information from unreliable information.

To that end, we consider one promient club, Chelsea Football Club, and its transfer activities during and immediately preceding the summer transfer window of 2020.  

As a data source, we are using the archives of The Guardian, a major UK newspaper.  Specifically, through its public api, we have downloaded its entire football coverage from April 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020.  It was possible to do this by requesting a key from open-platform.theguardian.com and running a script written by Dan Nguyen and published at gist.github.com/dannguyen/c9cb220093ee4c12b840 with very minor modifications.

A sample article similar to what is received as a response to an api request is copied to the sample_data folder of this repository.\
