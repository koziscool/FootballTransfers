This project is an inquiry into the player transfer market of the English Premier League (EPL), with an eye towards identifying heuristics or patterns to differentiate reliable information from unreliable information.

To that end, we consider one promient club, Chelsea Football Club, and its transfer activities during and immediately preceding the summer transfer window of 2020.  

As a data source, we are using the archives of The Guardian, a major UK newspaper.  Specifically, through its public api, we have downloaded its entire football coverage from April 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020.
