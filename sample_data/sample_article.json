The players\u2019 union made that suggestion in an unusually detailed statement in response to widespread calls for Premier League footballers to take pay cuts \u2013 including from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, at the government\u2019s daily Covid-19 press conference, where he was standing in for the prime minister, Boris Johnson. As Premier League clubs prepared to meet on Friday, Hancock and the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, the Conservative MP Julian Knight, said they wanted to see players reduce their pay, as elite footballers became a visible focus of public criticism. Hancock, asked whether he thought players should take a cut rather than have clubs put their non-playing staff on the government\u2019s furlough scheme, which pays 80% of employees\u2019 wages up to a maximum \u00a32,500 per month, linked top players\u2019 pay to the deaths of NHS workers. \u201cGiven the sacrifices that many people are making, including some of my colleagues in the NHS who have made the ultimate sacrifice of going into work and have caught the disease and have sadly died, I think the first thing that Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution, take a pay cut and play their part,\u201d he said. Earlier Knight had described top players being paid in full while non-playing staff lose some of their wages on furlough as \u201can obscene situation\u201d and called for a windfall tax on clubs operating in that manner. Tottenham and Newcastle have announced their intention to furlough staff, as well as Norwich and Bournemouth, who both said they would top up the \u00a32,500 limit to ensure employees are not losing wages. In a statement, released after another day of talks with the Premier League and EFL, the PFA said: \u201cThe players we have spoken to recognise that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly.
