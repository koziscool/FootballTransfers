In the context of the football transfer market, we want to develop heuristics and metrics to distinguish, as much as we are capable, reliable information and reliable sources, from unreliable information and unreliable sources.

As it relates to business value, it is useful to emphasize that our motivation is almost entirely about the information angle.  There is little opportunity to leverage information about the transfer market for business purposes.

However, in general terms, the capacity to accurately determine credibility of information is a monumentally valuable asset, with possible applications in finance, recruiting, defense and intelligence, corporate strategy and politics, just to name a few.


Roster composition for football teams in the EPL (English Premier League) and other major leagues around the world is largely determined by the transfer market.  In the transfer market, a player from one club is sold to another for an amount of money agreed on between the two clubs

Accordingly, there is a huge amount of interest from football fans in the transfer market, especially during the offseason.  From that, there is a large number of reports, speculation, rumours, and other information from the football press and other purveyors of information to address this demand.


To that end, we query every player that Chelsea bought in summer 2020 against every piece of content published in The Guardian Football section.  As a first approximation, we consider it to be a match if the string “Chelsea” and the player’s name are both in the same piece of content.

Then, we compare those matches against a similar methodology for a small number of other players that Chelsea was known to be considering.  Seeing promising results, we extended these queries to a larger list of 440 of the world’s best footballers.

The guiding logic is the hope that if The Guardian repeatedly mentions a given player significantly more often than an otherwise comparable player, it is a positive indication that Chelsea will acquire that player.
